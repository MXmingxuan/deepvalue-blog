## About Me

Hi, I'm Mingxuan Song.

From Private Markets to Public Equities. With 3 years of experience in primary market industrial investment (PE/VC), I now focus on identifying asymmetric opportunities in the stock market.

Why "Deep Value"? The name stems from my roots in the Graham-and-Doddsville school of deep undervaluation. However, my framework has evolved to include:

Capital Cycle Analysis (Marathon Asset Management style)

Special Situations (Early Buffett arbitrage/control)

Growth & Tech (The Gorilla Game strategy & Crypto)

Quantitative Factors (Bridging fundamental analysis with quant methods)

AI-Augmented Investor. I leverage AI daily to scale my research capabilities and accelerate personal growth. I also use AI coding tools to build custom utilities for my investment workflow.
